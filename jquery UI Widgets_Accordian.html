<h3><a href="#">Part 4 :jQuery plugin</a></h3>
<div>
<p>
Because of jQuery's architecture, other developers can use its constructs to create plug-in code to extend
 its functionality. Currently there are thousands of jQuery plug-ins available on the web[11] that cover a 
wide range of functionality such as Ajax helpers, webservices, datagrids, dynamic lists, XML and XSLT tools,
 drag and drop, events, cookie handling, modal windows, even a jQuery-based Commodore 64 emulator
</p>
<p>
An important source of jQuery plug-ins is the Plugins sub-domain of the jQuery Project website. There are
 alternative plug-in search engines that take more specialist approaches, such as only listing plug-ins that meet 
certain criteria (e.g. those that have a public code repository).
